Project Overview

This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify facial expressions into two categories: happy and sad. It leverages image data collected from Kaggle to train, validate, and test the model.

The goal is to create an efficient and accurate system that can identify emotional expressions in faces.

Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled images of faces showing happy or sad expressions. The images were sourced from Kaggle
, where a curated dataset of facial expressions was used for training.

Number of images: [add count]

Classes: Happy, Sad

Format: Images in JPG/PNG format organized into respective folders

Installation

Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8+). Then, install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Main dependencies:

TensorFlow

Keras

NumPy

Matplotlib

OpenCV (optional, if used for image processing)

Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/happy-sad-face-detection.git
cd happy-sad-face-detection


Prepare your dataset in the expected folder structure:

/dataset
    /happy
    /sad


Run the training script:

python train.py


Run the prediction script on new images:

python predict.py --image path_to_image.jpg

Model Architecture

The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for image classification, consisting of:

Multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation

MaxPooling layers for downsampling

Fully connected dense layers

Softmax output layer for classification between happy and sad

Training

Data augmentation techniques were applied to improve model robustness.

The model was trained for [X] epochs with a batch size of [Y].

Loss function: Categorical cross-entropy

Optimizer: Adam

Results

Training accuracy: 81%

Validation accuracy: 90%

Example predictions:

Image	Prediction
happy_face1.jpg	Happy
sad_face1.jpg	Sad
